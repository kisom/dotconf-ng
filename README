Updated every thing. Notably, though, my .emacs.d/ is missing.

The configuration is being reworked to reflect the new setup of things:

* emacs as an editor
* stumpwm as a window manager
* zsh as the terminal emulator

I've been reworking some of my configuration files, and this is the
result. Namely, I've switched to ksh(1) as my primary shell.
